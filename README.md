# OpenCV-stuff

This repository contains stuff that I did in python and C++ using OpenCV. Test "polygons" for my programs were Arma 3 (the game) and google earth/maps.

Also included are videos shoving results of some of the python apps. The C++ apps work more or less the same way.

P.S. I will also include the Arma 3 mission where I tested my code. The "my2nddll" file contains the "communications interface" I use to 
communicate between the game and the C++ or Python apps.
